>>> Version 25.0.0 of the XLibre input/video drivers introduces a change 
    for the versioning scheme:

    * using semantic versioning now
    * aligning driver versions with Xserver release series
    * branching per Xserver release series

    The major version - as in the first two digits - of the drivers is
    the minimum required Xserver release.
